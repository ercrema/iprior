Based on the manuscript entitled "Objective Bayes regression using I-priors" by Wicher Bergsma [2016, unpublished]. In a linear regression setting, priors can be assigned to the regression function using a vector space framework, and the posterior estimate of the regression function obtained. I-priors are a class of such priors based on the principle of maximum entropy.

This package performs linear regression modelling using I-priors in R. It is intuitively designed to be similar to `lm`, with both formula and non-formula based input. The parameters of an I-prior model are the scale parameters of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) over the set of covariates, `lambda`, and the standard deviation of model errors, `sigma`. While the main interest of I-prior modelling is prediction, inference is also possible, e.g. via log-likelihood ratio tests.

For installation instructions and some examples of I-prior modelling, continue reading below. The package is documented with help files, and the [wiki](https://github.com/haziqjamil/iprior/wiki/) is a good source to view some discussion topics and further examples.

## Installation

R/iprior makes use of several C++ code, so as a prerequisite, you must have a working C++ compiler. To get it:

-   On Windows, install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
-   On Mac, install Xcode from the app store.
-   On Linux, `sudo apt-get install r-base-dev` or similar.

Install R/iprior by downloading the latest CRAN release.

```r
install.packages("iprior")
library(iprior)
```

If you wish to install the latest developmental release, then you can do so by getting it from this GitHub repository. To do this, you must first install the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package.

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

Then, run the following code to install and attach the `iprior` package.

``` r
install_github("haziqjamil/iprior")
library(iprior)
```

## Syntax

To fit an I-prior model to `mod` regressing `y` against `x`, where these are contained in the data frame `dat`, the following syntax are equivalent.

``` r
mod <- iprior(y ~ x, data = dat)  # formula based input
mod <- iprior(y = dat$y, x = dat$x)  # non-formula based input
```

The call to `iprior()` can be accompanied by model options in the form of `model = list()`, such as choosing the RKHS, number of scale parameters, and others. Control options for the EM algorithm fit is done through the option `control = list()`. Find the full list of options by typing `?iprior` in R.
